Thank you for your support!

I really appreciate it whenever I see someone has sent me a donation and it certainly helps.

To show you how grateful I am, I've just cast [Guidance](https://discord.gg/ZAasSVS) on you right now! Use it wisely. :)

If you've added a note to your donation, expect me to add it to the list of testimonials. It will be displayed as being from an anonymous donor, but if you wish me to display your name, or to remove the note, and you haven't specified it in the note already, then let me know by simply contacting me on the Beyond20 [Discord](https://discord.gg/ZAasSVS) or on [Github](https://github.com/kakaroto/Beyond20)
