# Known issues

Some issues are known to me and are being worked on, others might be caused by a new feature that was just added in the latest update and I'm facepalming at not catching it before I made the release. 

Head over to the [support](support) page to see the list of known issues.

If you find an issue that isn't in the list or in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/kakaroto/Beyond20/issues), I'd appreciate you letting me know about it!
