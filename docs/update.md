# Known issues

Some issues are known to me and are being worked on, others might be caused by a new feature that was just added in the latest update and I'm facepalming at not catching it before I made the release. 

Head over to the [support](support) page to see the list of known issues.

If you find an issue that isn't in the list or in the issue tracker, I'd appreciate you letting me know about it!
