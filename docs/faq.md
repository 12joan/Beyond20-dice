There's not much yet in terms of FAQ or support questions, I'm sure this FAQ will grow with time, but for now, here's what I got :

**Q**: Can I do 'this' or 'that'?

**A**: Surprisingly, I received a few questions on how to do things that are already supported, so I would suggest the first thing to do is to check your extension settings. 

Click on the Beyond20 icon in your browser's toolbar, if you are on a D&D Beyond character sheet, it will pop up the quick settings and character sheet specific settings. If you are on the Roll20 VTT page, it will pop up the quick settings and Roll20 specific settings. In both cases, you can click the `More options` button to access the full extension options.

You can also go to your browser's Extensions page and open the options for Beyond20 that way.

**Q**: All I see in Roll20 is an empty message, how can I fix it?

**A**: That's because the game in Roll20 is set up to use a character sheet template other than "D&D 5e By Roll20". 

Beyond20 uses display templates from that character sheet template to make the rolls, so if it's not the one configured in the Roll20 game, then it won't work.

To fix the issue, simply go to the Roll20 game settings and select "D&D 5e By Roll20" for the character sheet.

If you cannot do that (you're not the DM) or you don't wish to do it (you prefer another template), then go to the Beyond20 options and select "Other templates" in the "Character sheet templates" option.

**Q**: In update v0.0.8, it says it can sync up HP from D&D Beyond to Roll20, but it doesn't work. Am I doing something wrong ?

**A**: No, sorry about that, that's a bug from my side, it would only work if the [VTT ES](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vtt-enhancement-suite/fadcomaehamhdhekodcpiglabcjkepff?hl=en-GB) extension was enabled, but I've already fixed the bug, so once v0.0.9 is released, the HP management should work for everybody.
