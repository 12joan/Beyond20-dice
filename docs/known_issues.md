* Jack of all Trades bonus for raw ability checks is currently broken (fixed in dev)
* Clicking "Display on Roll20" for a weapon or spell attack will also make it roll the attack (fixed in dev)
* Does not work if the chat window is popped out
* Spell attack modifier on the Spells main screen doesn't show the dice icon if in mobile mode (small window resolution)
  * I have no idea why, for now, I could only get it to work when in 'desktop view'
