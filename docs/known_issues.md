* Action buttons on monster pages have lost their red themed skin (fixed in dev version)
* In Chrome, setting a custom dice formula and dismissing the popup without pressing Enter or focusing on another element does not save the dice formula
  * I don't know if it's fixable, for now, just press Enter after setting the custom dice formula
* Does not work if the chat window is popped out
* Spell attack modifier on the Spells main screen doesn't show the dice icon if in mobile mode (small window resolution)
  * I have no idea why, for now, I could only get it to work when in 'desktop view'
