* Foundry VTT: A critical hit dice with Improved Critical or Superior Critical won't appear green when displayed if it's not 20
* Roll20: Does not work if the chat window is popped out
* Chrome: Setting a custom dice formula and dismissing the popup without pressing Enter or focusing on another element does not save the dice formula
  * I don't know if it's fixable, for now, just press Enter after setting the custom dice formula
