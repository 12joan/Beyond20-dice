- Cannot separate to-hit and damage dice (disabled "auto roll damages" option) when using the Digital Dice.
- Quick roll tooltip have their positions shifted if there is an ad banner ("Get the Mythic Dice Set" for example) at the top of the D&D Beyond page
- Rolling Initiative to Roll20 with the new Digital Dice (or using non OGL template), will not add the initiative to tracker
- The 'Cast' button for casting spells directly from the sheet is preventing D&D Beyond from marking used spell slots.
