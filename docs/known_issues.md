* Mouse over tooltips (spells, abilities) stop working in monster stat blocks
   * Workaround: For now, disable the option to substitute the dice formulas to fix it
* Sneak attack bonus does not get doubled when on a critical hit
* Does not work if the chat window is popped out
* Spell attack modifier on the Spells main screen doesn't show the dice icon if in mobile mode (small window resolution)
  * I have no idea why, for now, I could only get it to work when in 'desktop view'
